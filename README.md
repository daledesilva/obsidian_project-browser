# Obsidian Project Browser
A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that replaces your new tab window with a card layout of the files in each folder organised by state. The view is filterable with an inbuilt search field (just start typing!), and files can be assigned a state from a prominent menu within the note.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful
>As with most Obsidian plugins, this is a free gift to the community, provided 'as is' to help you out. While I'm doing my best to make it awesome (And I love feedback), there are always chances things might not work quite right. To be safe, **please always back up your files**.

## ü™≥ Report a bug
Found something that's not quite working right or do you have a feature request? Don't be shy, feel free to make some noise over on the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/daledesilva/obsidian_project-browser/issues) page. But be sure to check if someone has already posted the same issue and comment on theirs if they have.
